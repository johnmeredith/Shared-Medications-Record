# About The Project
Hi there! :fa-thumbs-up:

We're building a shared medicines record for use across NHS Wales and work for the [Digital Health and Care Wales](https://dhcw.nhs.wales/ "DHCW Web Site"). We're also getting a little help from [FreshEHR](https://freshehr.com/ "FreshEHR Ltd") and our friends at [Apperta Foundation](https://apperta.org/ "The Apperta Foundation"). 

If you are interested in this project, please reach out to us. 

Grab a coffee. We'll be here a while. :fa-coffee:
