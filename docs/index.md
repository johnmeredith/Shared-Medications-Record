Welcome to the NWIS Shared Medication Record Project

## Overview
The Shared Medicines and Adverse Reaction (SMA) clinical record focusses on bringing together multiple, disparate actors who produce and consume digital medication records into a “single source of truth”. This will also contain allergies, intolerances and other sensitivity records at a patient level.
